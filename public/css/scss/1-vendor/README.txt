The vendor folder is where we place CSS files that come from third parties and can be updated at any
time. As the .scss syntax is CSS compatible, all we have to do is to rename the .css file to .scss,
in order for it to be integrated to the .css compilation instead of referenced by the CSS file as a
classic @import.

The same thing can be done with SCSS/SASS file.

Per example : librairies, normalize, etc..
